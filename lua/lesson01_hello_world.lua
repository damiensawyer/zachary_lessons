-- Lesson 1: Hello World!
-- Welcome to Lua programming! Let's start with the most famous program ever.

-- This line prints "Hello, World!" to the screen
print("Hello, World!")

-- Let's try some other messages too!
print("My name is Zachary!")
print("I am learning Lua!")
print("Programming is fun!")

-- Try it yourself:
-- 1. Change "Hello, World!" to say something different
-- 2. Add your own print() statement with your favorite color
-- 3. Run this file by typing: lua lesson01_hello_world.lua

-- Fun fact: print() is a function that shows text on the screen!
