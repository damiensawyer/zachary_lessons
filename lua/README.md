# Lua Programming Lessons for Kids

A complete 15-lesson curriculum designed to teach Lua programming to a 9-year-old, progressing from basic concepts to building a complete 2D game with Love2D.

## How to Run the Lessons

### Lessons 1-9 (Basic Lua)
```bash
lua lesson01_hello_world.lua
lua lesson02_variables.lua
# ... and so on
```

### Lessons 10-15 (Love2D Game Development)
1. Install Love2D from https://love2d.org/
2. For each lesson, save the code as `main.lua` in a new folder
3. Drag the folder onto the Love2D application to run

## Lesson Overview
