-- Lesson 2: Variables - Storing Information
-- Variables are like boxes where we can store information!

-- Numbers
my_age = 9
favorite_number = 42
print("I am", my_age, "years old")
print("My favorite number is", favorite_number)

-- Words (we call these "strings")
my_name = "Zachary"
favorite_food = "pizza"
print("Hello, my name is", my_name)
print("I love", favorite_food)

-- We can change what's in our variables!
my_age = 10  -- Happy birthday!
print("Next year I will be", my_age)

-- Math with variables
apples = 5
oranges = 3
total_fruit = apples + oranges
print("I have", total_fruit, "pieces of fruit")

-- Try it yourself:
-- 1. Create a variable for your favorite animal
-- 2. Create variables for how many pets you have
-- 3. Print a sentence using your variables
